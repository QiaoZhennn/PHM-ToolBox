# PHM-ToolBox
This is me undergraduate project, aiming to help novices in mechanical fault diagnostics field to learn Prognotics and Health Management (PHM), Developed by me and Yongyu, at AIMS, Hangzhou, China.

This software is developed by MATLAB, only for research use. In addition, this software uses a bearing vibration signal dataset provided by NASA.

The directory structure of PHM ToolBox showes below:
